I am a research associate working as part of the Advanced Processor Technologies ([APT](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk)) Research Group at [The University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk) on Heterogeneous Virtual Machines using GPUs and FPGAs.
Currently I am working as part of the [E2Data](https://e2data.eu/) European project for bringing automatic GPU and FPGA JIT compilation and execution for Java programs. 
I am interested on combining GPUGPU computing and FPGA acceleration with interpreted programming languages such R, Ruby and Java through automatic parallelisation, compilation and transparent execution.

I did my PhD at The University of Edinburgh under the supervision of [Dr. Christophe Dubach](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdubach) and [Dr. Michel Steuwer](http://michel.steuwer.info/) on Accelerating Interpreted Programming Languages on GPUs with Just-In-Time and Runtime Optimisations.


Before doing the PhD, I did my degree at The University of La Laguna (Tenerife, Spain) and I did my final project on the [accULL](https://accull.wordpress.com) compiler, the first open-source OpenACC compiler under the supervision of Dr. Ruyman Reyes and Dr. Francisco de Sande.
