### Abstract


In this paper we outline the current state of language Virtual Machines (VMs) running on RISC-V as well as our initiatives in augmenting the existing ecosystem with Maxine VM, a state-of-the-art open source research Virtual Machine (VM). Maxine VM is a metacircular VM for Java and is currently part of the Beehive ecosystem that provides a unified framework for hardware/software co-designed research on managed languages runtimes.
