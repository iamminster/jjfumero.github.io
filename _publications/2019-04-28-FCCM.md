### Abstract

Authors: Michail Papadimitriou, Juan Fumero, Athanasios Stratikopoulos, Christos Kotselidis.

In this work, we propose an approach for transparent compilation and execution of Java programs onto Intel FPGA devices. In detail, we showcase how a managed runtime environment can leverage Intel OpenCL SDK to generate specialized FPGA code, enabling prototyping and acceleration of Java Programs onto FPGAs. Finally, we describe our implementation in the context of TornadoVM with a clear objective to ease FPGA programmability allowing integration with existing frameworks.
