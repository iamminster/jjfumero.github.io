I was tutoring the Introduction to Object Obriented Programming through Java to groups of 8-10 of undergraduate students during Spring 2015 and 2016. We covered an introduction to topics such as Object Oriented Programming, inheritance, Java collections, Threads, concurrency and parallelism. We also covered some material about how the Java Virtual Machine works.
